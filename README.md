## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how the temperature at different times of the year might impact whether or not a surf/ice cream shop is viable year round on Oahu. We looked into the daily temperatures during June and December, and found the basic summary temperature statistics, including high, low and average temperatures.

## Results
Images of the summary statistics referenced below can be found in the included Resources folder. Below are three key differences between the months of June and December found during the temperature analysis.

### Differences
- The lowest daily temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees, while in December the lowest temperature was 56 degrees.
- The temperature standard deviation is higher for the month of December than it is for June, and the differences between the extremes and each quartile statistic is higher in December, indicating there is more variability in December temperatures than there is for June.
- The mean and median temperatures for June are both about 4 degrees higher in June (75 degrees) than they are for December (71 degrees).
