# Surfs_Up
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how the temperature at different times of the year might impact whether or not a surf/ice cream shop is viable year round on Oahu. We looked into the daily temperatures during June and December, and found the basic summary temperature statistics, including high, low and average temperatures.

## Results
Images of the summary statistics referenced below can be found in the included Resources folder. Below are three key differences between the months of June and December found during the temperature analysis.

### Differences
- The lowest daily temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees, while in December the lowest temperature was 56 degrees.
- The temperature standard deviation is higher for the month of December than it is for June, and the differences between the extremes and each quartile statistic is higher in December, indicating there is more variability in December temperatures than there is for June.
- The mean and median temperatures for June are both about 4 degrees higher in June (75 degrees) than they are for December (71 degrees).

## Summary
The June temperatures show that it is definitely viable to operate a surfing/ice cream shop on Oahu during the summer months, and December temperatures show that it should be sustainable year round as well. With 75% of days in December having temperatures 69 degrees or higher and 75% of days in June with temperatures 73 degrees or higher, there is good surfing and ice cream weather year round on Oahu.

Two additional queries that we could run to provide some more analysis into the June and December weather data would include analyzing daily precipitation data to see what percentage of days have weather/precipitation and how likely it would be for people to be out surfing or looking for ice cream on a given day. Another query could be looking into possible temperature changes throughout the day and what could be the most likely busy hours for a surfing/ice cream shop on Oahu or if cooler temperatures in certain hours of the day during different times of the year could impact business.
